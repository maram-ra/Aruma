## User Stories

### Must Have (MVP)

1. **User Registration & Login**
   - As an **artisan**, I want to register and log in, so that I can manage my profile.  
   - As a **client**, I want to register and log in, so that I can browse artisans and send requests.  

   *Simple MVP scope:* Email, password, and basic authentication only. No social logins or advanced security layers at this stage.  

---

2. **Artisan Profile**
   - As an **artisan**, I want to create and update my profile with details and images, so that clients can view my work.  
   - As a **client**, I want to view artisan profiles, so that I can evaluate their work.  

   *Simple MVP scope:* Profile includes name, bio, craft type, and images. No advanced customization or categories yet.  

---

3. **Marketplace Browsing**
   - As a **client**, I want to browse artisans in a marketplace, so that I can discover products, workshops, and live shows.  
   - As an **anonymous visitor**, I want to preview the marketplace, so that I can see artisans before registering.  

   *Simple MVP scope:* Basic list/grid of artisans with name, bio snippet, and one featured image. No filters or advanced search in MVP.  

---

4. **Collaboration Requests**
   - As a **client**, I want to send a request to an artisan, so that I can collaborate with them.  
   - As an **artisan**, I want to accept or reject client requests, so that I can control my work.  

    *Simple MVP scope:* Request form with type (product/workshop/live show) + message. Artisan can only “accept” or “reject”. No messaging/chat yet.  

---

5. **Basic Contract Flow**
   - As an **artisan**, I want to specify cost and timeframe when accepting a request, so that the client knows the conditions.  
   - As a **client**, I want to confirm the artisan’s terms, so that we both agree on a clear contract.  
   - As a **system**, I want to track request status (pending, accepted, rejected, completed).  

   *Simple MVP scope:* Only status tracking. No legal documents or payment integration yet.  

---

6. **Profile Enhancement**
   - As an **artisan**, I want completed requests to appear on my profile, so that I can build credibility with clients.  

    *Simple MVP scope:* Show list of completed requests in profile. No ratings or reviews yet.

### Future Features (Beyond MVP)

- **Payment Integration** → Secure payments inside the platform.  
- **User Reviews & Ratings** → Feedback system for artisans.  
- **Service Verification** → Verified badge for artisans.

### Notes
- **Adapt to the MVP:** All stories are simplified to the minimum scope needed.  
- **Collaborate Actively:** Stories will be split among team members (Backend: APIs & DB, Frontend: UI, UI/UX: flows & wireframes, QA: testing).  
- **Keep it Clear and Simple:** Each story focuses on one functionality only, described in plain language without extra complexity.
