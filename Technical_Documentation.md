### User Stories (MoSCoW Prioritization)

#### Must Have 
- As an **artisan**, I want to **register and log in**, so that I can access and manage my account.  
- As a **client**, I want to **register and log in**, so that I can use the platform to request services or buy products.  
- As an **artisan**, I want to **create and update my profile with craft details and images**, so that clients can see my work.  
- As a **client**, I want to **browse artisans’ profiles in the marketplace**, so that I can explore products and services.  
- As a **client**, I want to **send collaboration requests** (purchase, workshop, live show), so that I can interact with artisans.  
- As an **artisan**, I want to **accept or reject collaboration requests**, so that I can manage my work and schedule.  
- As an **artisan**, I want to **set the cost and timeframe** for accepted requests, so that the client has clear expectations.  
- As an **artisan**, I want **completed offers to be added to my profile**, so that I can build credibility and attract more clients.  

#### Should Have

#### Could Have 
- As a **client**, I want to **filter artisans by category or type of service**, so that I can quickly find what I need.  
- As an **artisan**, I want to **share my profile link externally**, so that I can promote my work outside the platform.
