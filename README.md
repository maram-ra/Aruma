## Stage 2: Project Charter

### Project Objectives

**Purpose:**  
The main goal of the platform is to empower artisans to easily showcase their products and services, reach more clients, and grow their presence through a comprehensive digital space that includes selling handcrafted products, offering live show requests, and organizing interactive workshops.

**Target Audience:**

**Primary Audience**  
- Artisans: Use the platform to showcase their work, reach more people, and offer live shows, such as a potter creating a piece on the spot.

**Secondary Audience**  
- Clients: Anyone who wants to place an order from artisans, such as buying handcrafted products, booking live shows, or attending workshops.

**SMART Objectives:**  
1. Launch an MVP within 6 weeks that allows at least two types of users (artisans and clients) to register, create profiles, and manage contracts within the platform.  
2. Enable real interactions between users through collaboration requests, where recipients can accept or reject offers.  
3. Gather usability feedback from at least 3 test users within one week after MVP completion to improve the next development phase.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low platform reach among the target audience after MVP launch due to limited marketing efforts. | Medium        | Use social media groups and local artisan/client networks to get early users and spread by word of mouth. |
| Varying technical skills within the team, potentially causing delays in implementing some features. | High          | Assign tasks based on individual strengths, schedule internal learning sessions, or ask mentors for support. |
| Difficulty in building trust between artisans and clients, especially in joint projects. | Medium        | Include clear profile sections, testimonials, and a basic user review system in the MVP phase. |
