# Aruma

> A digital platform that empowers artisans to showcase their products and services, reach more clients, and strengthen their market presence through a comprehensive online space.


---

## 🌐 Live Demo

- **Live Website:** [Go to Aruma Website](https://aruma-seven.vercel.app/)

## 🎯 Project Overview

Many Saudi artisans struggle to find a unified digital space to present their handcrafted work, manage requests, and connect with modern clients.  

**Aruma** was created to bridge that gap by providing:

- A **dedicated profile** for artisans to present their work.
- A **marketplace** where clients can discover artisans.
- A **request and tracking system** connecting both sides.

This project was developed collaboratively as part of a portfolio project for [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) Supervised by [Tuwaiq Academy](https://tuwaiq.edu.sa/), and represents our shared vision to combine technology and culture in a meaningful way.
